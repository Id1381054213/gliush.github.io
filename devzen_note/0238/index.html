<ul>
<li>1.INTRODUCTION</li>
<li>Overload control aims to mitigate problems during service overload</li>
<li>For simple services, gateway monitors the load status and rejects
client requests (load schedding)</li>
<li>For complex SOA systems it is more difficult:
<ul>
<li>all services should be monitored</li>
<li>independent load schedding is hard to implement</li>
<li>with large number of services, high probability to not handle user request
because of some service rejects request</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>introduce overload control scheme DAGOR:
<ul>
<li>each client request is assigned with business priority and user priority</li>
<li>each microservice maintain its own priority thresholds</li>
<li>during overload, the threshold is increased (to sched half of the load), and new
threshold value is passed to the direct &ldquo;upstream microservices&rdquo;</li>
<li>these &ldquo;upper microservices&rdquo; don't send request with low priorities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2.WECHAT SERVICE ARCHITECTURE
<ul>
<li>DAG of services (directed acyclic graph)</li>
<li>leap services = number of outbound edges &gt; 0</li>
<li>basic services = number of outbound edges = 0</li>
<li>entry leap services = leap services with number of inboud edges = 0</li>
<li>total amount of requests to the entry services ~ 10^10 -10^11 per day!!</li>
<li>3k services</li>
<li>20k machines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3.OVERLOAD
<ul>
<li>Scenario1: ServiceA-&gt;ServiceM (overloaded)</li>
<li>Scenario2 (subsequent overload): ServiceA-&gt;ServiceM + ServiceA-&gt;ServiceM</li>
<li>Scenario3 (subsequent overload): ServiceA-&gt;ServiceM + ServiceA-&gt;ServiceN</li>
<li>For subsequent overload probability to handle request to serviceA: p=0.5 * p=0.5 =&gt; p=0.25</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4.DAGOR OVERLOAD CONTROL
<ul>
<li>Service agnostic. Can be run anywhere</li>
<li>Runs on each individual machine</li>
<li>!! load status = queue time (time difference between the request arrival and processing being started)</li>
<li>Response time is bad for leap services</li>
<li>CPU is bad because high CPU doesn't mean it is overloaded.</li>
<li>load is calculated every 2k requests or 1s (what is sooner)</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>20ms in the queue = the service is overloaded (default timeout for each service is 500ms)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business Oriented Admission Control
<ul>
<li>Business priorities (Login &gt; Pay &gt; Message &gt; ImageSent &gt; &hellip;)</li>
<li>Small table replicated on all the machines</li>
<li>Any request is assigned a business priority. Sub requests copy the same business priority</li>
<li>First provided API to change it, deprecated some time later</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User Oriented Admission Control
<ul>
<li>Problem: a lot of requests with the same business priority.
Turn off - too low load, turn on - too high load. Becomes flappy.</li>
<li>Generate hash for each. And sched load inside the same business priority
by user hash (hash priority)</li>
<li>Regenerate hash for each user every hour. For fairness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Session Oriented Admission Control
<ul>
<li>User login session hash - for the same purpose as user oriented admission control.</li>
<li>Users realized that relogin helps them (but doesn't help the system).</li>
<li>=&gt; Is not used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adaptive Admission Control
<ul>
<li>Each business level has 128 user levels -&gt; ~10k total levels (B,U)</li>
<li>O(N) - won't work, O(logN) - won't work =&gt; Histogram of all (B,U) requests</li>
<li>Adjusting the load
<ul>
<li>during overload, reduce the number of handled requests by A (5%) percent</li>
<li>if ok -&gt; increase the requests by B (1%) percent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5.EVALUATION
<ul>
<li>Comparison of different load indicators</li>
<li>Service admissoin control</li>
<li>Stress test</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMHO
<ul>
<li>It's the fist detailed overload handling system that works in production for several years.</li>
<li>There're several interesting design solutions that are not intuitive</li>
<li>It will not be widely used now, there're few companies that might need that.
All of them have similar systems already</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
