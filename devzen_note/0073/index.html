<li>Manifesto about the position</li>
<li>Cloud is a vital part that you don’t own or control</li>
<li>“Cloud” was used to represent outside network since 1980s</li>
<li>If you fail - who blame you? It’s a cloud. Soft, huggable cloud.</li>
<li>if you lose your shit, the technologies will not help you. They will giggle at you and make fun of your not understanding the fundamental principles and engineering of client-server models</li>
<li>The question is about value</li>
<li>Porn, music, films - you can redownload</li>
<li>The thing you make: writing, linking of friends, … -  everything is gone when you’re died</li>
<li>If you’re not asking what stuff means anything to you - you are a sucker, ready to throw your stuff down.</li>
<li>But some people are dumping hundreds of hours a year into the cloud (photos, opinions, relations, …)</li>
<li>Internet - is a big copy machine</li>
<li>Blows copies into the cloud, but please:
<ul>
<li>don’t blow anything that you don’t have a personal copy of</li>
<li>insult, berate any company that offers you something, that you can’t make copies out of</li>
<li>Recognise a Cloud when you see it. Pay to become a customer.</li>
<li>If you want to take advantage of the froth - do so, but these are parties, and not home.</li>
</ul>
