<li>Better read the paper, it's not that difficult</li>
<li>Idea1: All the memory cells during reads could influence cells in the same column on the nearest row</li>
<li>Idea2: Put your memory between rows with a secret (how to do that explained below):

</li>
<li>As you have EQUAL cells containing secret above and below your cell, they will influence the same way.</li>
<li>Perform many reads in (A0) cells, that will the cells with secrets activate cells in your memory</li>
<li>If you had <code>0</code> in your cell and after the experiment, it didn't change -&gt; secret has <code>0</code> in the corresponding cell</li>
<li>If you had <code>0</code> in your cell and after the experiment, it switched to <code>1</code> -&gt; secret has <code>1</code> in the corresponding cell</li>
<li>PROFIT!</li>
<li>All other 17 pages of the paper they explain how to put a secret in the needed places and how DRAM works</li>
